### Analysis Results:

After conducting the analysis, it was revealed that the main issues faced by the company are related to the distribution of the advertising budget. Currently, 80% of the budget is allocated to two advertising sources - TipTop and Faceboom. However, the cost of acquiring customers through these channels is excessively high, leading to unprofitable investments. Additionally, a significant portion of the funds is spent on advertising in the USA, where the return on investment is considerably lower, further exacerbating the company's losses.

It is recommended to reconsider the distribution of the advertising budget by focusing on sources that show a positive return on investment. This will help reduce expenses on acquiring customers that do not yield desired results. Furthermore, efforts should be strengthened to attract customers from the USA with lower costs and a positive ROI.

Before making a final decision to abandon the use of TipTop and Faceboom sources, it is advisable to check the settings of the advertising campaigns to rule out the possibility of misidentifying the target audience. If the target audience has been correctly identified, it is recommended to temporarily (e.g., for 6 months) refrain from using these sources. It is possible that the target audience exists, but the cost of attracting them through these sources is too high for the company. In other words, at this stage of the business's development and stability, such expenditures are not affordable.

When considering the European market, attention should be given to sources with a conversion rate higher than 3% and a positive ROI. It is recommended to distribute the budget evenly among them. Additionally, it is necessary to analyze the reasons for the lack of profitability in the largest user group within the IOS segment (iPhone and Mac). Perhaps the issue is related to the application's settings or interface.

Overall, reallocating the advertising budget according to the described recommendations will help reduce business losses and enhance the effectiveness of customer acquisition.
